## The While Loop

# While loop will run until a certain condition is TRUE

current_num = 1

while current_num <= 5: # Loop runs while the current_num variable is less or equal to 5
    
    print(current_num) # Outputs the value for current_num variable

    current_num +=1 # Increments the current_num variable by 1
